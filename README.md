### Reflection Questions
#### We use HTML to deliver content on web pages and CSS to style those web pages. Where does JavaScript fit in? What can JavaScript do that HTML/CSS cannot?
JavaScript is a full fledged programming language data types and flow control. This allows developers to create logic which adds interactivity to an otherwise static web.  
#### JavaScript, much like many other programming languages, utilizes functions. What is the advantage to using functions over 'spaghetti code'?
Encapsulating logic into functions allows for testability, reusability, and readability. 'Spaghetti code' requires developers to understand a much larger amount of code at once, adding complexity to a developers job.
#### Application Programming Interfaces (APIs) are a great resource for any web developer. Explain in your own words what an API is, why it is important, and talk about any APIs you've explored or plan to use.
APIs define a contract between a producer and a consumer. The producer of the API generally wants to expose some function to a consumer, such as geolocation of an IP address. 
The producer documents how the consumer can interact with the function by describing what arguments the function requires the consumer to submit and the structure and types of data the function will return.
I've consumed APIs from Google Maps, ZenDesk, Facebook, and many others. I've yet to be a producer of an API. One day!
